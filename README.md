Automated Exam Project

This is a project where we take the 5 latest article on Wired.com directly from the web site (using web crawling with HTML Agility Pack) and give them to the user within a test form so the user can easily prepare an English exam. Build with .NET Core, Entity Framework, HTML Agility Pack, SQLite.
